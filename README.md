# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project 
### The purpose of this analysis is to get acquainted with data provided and to uncover hidden historical trends by making it more readable, filtering any unnecessary data, removing any outliers, adding visual presentations like Pivot Charts and Tables which would help Data Analyst to make sound judgment and business decisions.



## Analysis and Challenges
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered - I initially encountered some difficulties when applying Formulas in Excel, especially with "COUNTIFS", but going through reading materials and with the help of Microsoft Support website, I'm getting more confident.



## Results
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date - Successful Vs Failed shows: We can see that during the second quarter of any given year, there's a high chance of success rate with theatre category. Failed category even though much less in number compared to successful shows, follows similar trend during any time of the year. Although during the middle of second quarter (May), success show trend rate steeps much more sharply than failed shows do. Towards the end of any given year, we can see that the number of successful and failed shows are much closer to each other. Cancelled shows are equally spread in numbers throughout any given year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals - This analysis displays that the success rate is much higher when the goal amount is either less than $1,000 or between $30,000 to $45,000 and then it steeps drastically when goal amount exceeds $45,000. The Failure rate is showing gradual increase as we increase the goal amount but reacts totally differently from Success rate as we reach goal amount between $25,000 to $30,000 and again when goal amount exceeds $45,000. there were no cancelled shows in this analysis.



## Some limitations of this dataset?
### The distribution in this dataset is skewed as we can see the Mean is much higher than the MEDIAN for both successful and failed campaigns. This dataset also has high number of outliers, we can see that the lower quartile sits close to the x-axis, which means that a quarter of the data does not have any value.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
### According to my understanding, Line charts depict much clearer visualizations when we're determining historical trends. Hence, we used Line charts for this data when we wanted to analyze outcomes based on Goals. We could also use Bar Chart when we calculated Mean, Median, Mode and Standard Deviation to visualize how the data is spread throughout.
